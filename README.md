# Beyoncé's Billboard Booms
## Final project for Jacob Koehler's Data and Design with Python course at The New School, spring 2021.
*By Claire Boudour*

## The Assignment
For our final project, we had the choice of 3 different paths: data analysis, building a website, and working with neural nets. I chose to work with data analysis because, as a Journalism + Design major, I've come to see how important data can be in telling a story that might otherwise be obscured. However, with the freedom to look at any dataset and not just those with immediate news value, I also decided to take this project as an opportunity to play around and have some fun while still strengthening my skills. 

## The Datasets
This brought me to my first dataset, which I sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). After downloading and playing with a few different datasets that didn't really interest me, I settled on the [Billboard "The Hot 100" Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs) (charts.csv). This Billboard chart, released weekly, lists the 100 most popular songs that week based on a combination of radio play, single sales, and streaming. The dataset, which is updated quite regularly, holds "all 'The Hot 100' charts released since its inception in 1958." After playing around with the data for a few days, I realized that it made the most sense to focus on one artist in order to narrow down the massive dataset. And who better to focus on, than Queen Bey herself? Once I had done some analysis of the data as it pertained to Beyoncé specifically, I realized that I had more questions than this one dataset could answer. This brought me to the Texas Data Repository, where I found [Storytelling with Data - The Beyoncé Edition](https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18738/T8/XL8NIX). From here I downloaded a dataset holding the different music awards she has won during her career (awards.csv).

## The Skills
In order to answer all of the questions I had about Beyoncé, I had to use a few different skills and libraries that we worked with earlier in the semester. The libraries I imported were NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. While some questions were easy to answer, and just required calculations or a narrowing of the dataset (answers listed in text under relevant pieces of code), others were more complicated and best represented through visualization. For these visualizations I primarily used seaborn, as it allowed for more flexibility when working directly with the data, but the final chart was constructed manually with Matplotlib. Also I had never used Markdown before so writing this file was a new adventure!

## The Contents
This repository holds a few different files, all of which will be helpful in understanding my project. First and foremost, the file titled 'Final.ipynb' holds the code itself. This is where you can see my process and the results of the data analysis. I have also included the visualizations as .jpg files in order to be looked at more closely. The two datasets are available both inside the repository and at the pages linked above for those interested in looking into the topic further.
